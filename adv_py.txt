type → creates a nickname (alias)

When you write:

type Vector = list[float]


You are saying:

“Whenever I write the word Vector, it means a list of floats.”

 It does NOT make a new data type.
 It just gives a new name to an existing one.

 ype Vector = list[float] → Type Definition (creates a new type alias)

n: int = 5 / function hints → Type Annotation / Hint, not a definition
