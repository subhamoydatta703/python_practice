Exception handling means managing errors that happen during program execution so the program doesn’t crash.
It lets your program detect, handle, and recover from unexpected situations.

An exception is an error that occurs while a program is running.
When Python faces something it cannot handle, it throws (raises) an exception.

Example:
print(10 / 0)


Output:

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


Here, dividing by zero causes a ZeroDivisionError — an exception.

Why Use Exception Handling?

To avoid sudden program crashes

To give user-friendly error messages

To control what happens when something goes wrong

Syntax

try:
    # code that might cause an error
except:
    # code that runs if there is an error

Example

try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(10 / num)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can’t divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("That’s not a number!")

How It Works

Python runs the code inside the try block.

If no error → it skips the except part.

If error occurs → it jumps to the matching except block.

Program continues running normally.

| **Exception Name**      | **When it Happens**                         | **Example**                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **`ZeroDivisionError`** | Dividing a number by zero                   | `10 / 0`                                |
| **`ValueError`**        | When the data type is wrong                 | `int("abc")`                            |
| **`TypeError`**         | Operation between wrong data types          | `10 + "5"`                              |
| **`NameError`**         | Using a variable that isn’t defined         | `print(x)` (when x isn’t defined)       |
| **`IndexError`**        | Accessing a list index that doesn’t exist   | `a = [1,2,3]` → `a[5]`                  |
| **`KeyError`**          | Using a dictionary key that doesn’t exist   | `d = {"name": "Subhamoy"}` → `d["age"]` |
| **`FileNotFoundError`** | Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist    | `open("abc.txt")` (if file not found)   |
| **`AttributeError`**    | Trying to use an undefined method/attribute | `"hello".push()`                        |
| **`ImportError`**       | Importing a module that doesn’t exist       | `import notamodule`                     |
| **`IndentationError`**  | Wrong spacing in code                       | missing or extra spaces                 |
| **`SyntaxError`**       | Wrong Python syntax                         | `if True print("Hi")`                   |
