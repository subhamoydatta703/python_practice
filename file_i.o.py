# Opening a File

# To work with a file, you must first open it using the built-in open() function.
# Syntax:
# file = open("filename", "mode")

# Reading from a File

# You can read file content in several ways.

# (a) read()

# Reads the entire file as one string.

file=open("demo.txt", "r")
# print(file.read()) #read whole file
# print(file.read(5)) #read first 5 characters
# print(file.readline()) #read line by line 
file.close()
