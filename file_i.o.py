# Opening a File

# To work with a file, you must first open it using the built-in open() function.
# Syntax:
# file = open("filename", "mode")

# Reading from a File

# You can read file content in several ways.

# (a) read()

# Reads the entire file as one string.

file=open("demo.txt", "r")
# print(file.read()) #read whole file
# print(file.read(5)) #read first 5 characters

# readline()
# Reads one line at a time.
# print(file.readline()) #read line by line 
file.close()

#  Writing to a File

# You can create or overwrite files using 'w'. 
# it also returns the number of characters written to the file.

# file=open("demo.txt", "w")

# print(file.write("Hey bro< it's SD"))


# file.close()

# Appending to a File

# Appending means adding new content without deleting old data.

f = open("demo.txt", "a")
f.write("\nAdding another line!")
f.close()
