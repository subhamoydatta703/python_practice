A constructor is a special function in a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
In Python, the constructor is defined using the __init__() method.
It is used to initialize (set) the values or data of an object at the time of creation.
The first parameter of a constructor is always self, which refers to the current object.

__init__() is used for:

Assigning values to variables (attributes) of an object when it is created.

 Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll):
        self.name = name     # assigning value to object variable
        self.roll = roll     # assigning value to object variable

s1 = Student("Subhamoy", 54)
print(s1.name)   # Subhamoy
print(s1.roll)   # 54

The __init__() function always takes at least one parameter — self, which refers to the current object being created.
It allows the class to access and assign values to the object’s variables.
Using self, we can store data separately for each object.
 Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Object created!")

s1 = Student()

In Python, self refers to the current object of the class.
You don’t write self when creating an object because Python adds it automatically behind the scenes.
s1 = Student("Subhamoy", 24) **Note: don’t need to write s1 = Student(self, "Subhamoy", 24) because self is added by Python automatically.

# class and object attrubute:

| Type                 | Defined Where                          | Accessed By                                 | Shared or Unique          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Class Attribute**  | Inside class, **outside `__init__()`** | `ClassName.attribute` or `object.attribute` | 🔁 Shared by all objects  |
| **Object Attribute** | Inside `__init__()` using `self.`      | `object.attribute`                          | 🎯 Unique for each object |

A method in Python is a function that is written inside a class.
It is used to perform actions using the data and attributes of that class.
Every method has at least one parameter — self, which refers to the current object of the class.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):   # this is a method (constructor)
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):            # this is also a method
        print("Hello,", self.name)

# creating an object of the class
s1 = Student("Subhamoy")

# calling the method
s1.greet()

# def greet(self): → is a method (a function inside the class).

# self refers to the current object (s1 here).

# When we call s1.greet(), it prints Hello, Subhamoy.
